# Playing around with Neural Cellular Automata

This is a partial re-implementation of the cool Distill post: [Growing Neural Cellular Automata](https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/) (using Pytorch). My goals were 1) to do this as a coding exercise and 2) to have a platform for playing with some ideas I have around CAs.
